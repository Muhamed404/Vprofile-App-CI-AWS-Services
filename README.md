# Vprofile App ‚Äì CI/CD Pipeline

This repository contains the source code along with **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** configurations for the **Vprofile App**.  
The pipeline automates code analysis, artifact creation, publication, and deployment‚Äîleveraging AWS services for a secure, repeatable, and scalable delivery process.

## üöÄ Architecture Overview

![Pipeline Architecture Diagram](AWS-Ci.png) <!-- Replace with actual image path if different -->

According to the diagram above, the workflow proceeds as follows:

1. **Push Code**  
   Developer pushes changes to **Bitbucket**.

2. **Pipeline Trigger**  
   **AWS CodePipeline** triggers automatically on every commit and orchestrates the workflow.

3. **Code Analysis**  
   - **AWS CodeBuild** downloads dependencies from **AWS CodeArtifact**.  
   - Runs **unit tests**, **Checkstyle**, and **SonarCloud** analysis.  
   - Pipeline halts if the **SonarCloud quality gate** fails.

4. **Build Artifact**  
   - **AWS CodeBuild** compiles and packages the application.  
   - The generated `.war` artifact is pushed to an **AWS S3 bucket**.

5. **Software Testing (Development Environment)**  
   - The artifact is deployed to **AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Dev)**.  
   - The app connects to a managed **Amazon RDS MySQL** instance for its database layer.  
   - Automated or manual tests can be executed to validate the build.

6. **Deploy to Production**  
   - After successful validation, the same artifact is promoted and deployed to **AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Prod)**, which also uses **Amazon RDS MySQL** for production data.

> ‚úÖ **All Maven dependencies are securely fetched from AWS CodeArtifact to ensure reproducible builds.**  
> ‚úÖ **Application database is hosted on Amazon RDS (MySQL) for reliability, backups, and scalability.**

## üìå Database

The application database is hosted on **Amazon RDS for MySQL**.  
You can import the initial schema and data using the included dump file if needed:

- `src/main/resources/db_backup.sql`

To restore the dump locally or into RDS (via an accessible bastion or connection):

```bash
mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u <username> -p <database_name> < db_backup.sql
